AIRPOSITIVE

AirPositive is a website that is connected with the third-party API, AirVisual, to bring users real-time temperature and air quality in a designated city and state. The goal with this website was to not only provide users with the air quality within the area but also inform the users and what air quality is and how it affects us. The first page of the website is "Home" here is displayed two input boxes where the user inputs city and state using the dropbox provided, and once done, and it returns the data from the city and state. The next page is "Learn More," where users will find the basic information they need to know on air quality, such as exposure, WHO, smog, and more. Then the third page is the "Solutions" page, and this page displays different solutions which we can all do to improve the air quality of the environment. Finally, the last page is the "Subscribe" page here; users can input their data, such as their first name and email, to get in touch with AirPositive.

HOW IT WORKS
To open up the website on your browser, you can visit https://main.dsdoqtqnv1isp.amplifyapp.com/index.html. Once you are on the website, it will direct you to our home page; here, you will find the two input boxes, one labeled "city" and the other "state." You will insert the city and state you want to look up using the drop-down box provided. Once you have put both the city and state, it will automatically give you back the temperature and air quality.
