               If you live in a large city, air pollution is something that you're probably very familiar with. However, air pollution doesn't just exist in big cities anymore. Every day millions of people are exposed to air pollutants and other hazardous chemicals through the air they breathe.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>It's a major problem that has been around for decades and, in the past few years, air pollution has gained more attention from scientists and governments alike. With air quality declining in so many places, it's time to take a deeper look into what we're dealing with, so we can truly understand the gravity of  the situation. A lot of the information around air pollution is unknown to the general public, but it is important that we know these things in order to take appropriate action.

               Air pollution is caused by a combination of gaseous and particulate pollutants such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen dioxide emitted from point sources such as factories and motor vehicles that burn fuel. Some gaseous emissions are visible to the eye and sometimes may even diffuse into the atmosphere and become invisible. Particulate pollution, on the other hand, such as soot and black carbon, is always visible.

               How is WHO working with countries to reduce air pollution?
            </p>
            <p>
               WHO's main function is to identify and monitor those air pollutants with the greatest impact on people's health. WHO's task is to review and analyze the accumulated scientific evidence, and use expert advice to draw conclusions on how much different air pollutants affect health as well as identify effective measures to reduce the air pollution burden.

            <p><b>Nearly 40 percent of Americans live in areas with unhealthy levels of smog pollution.</b></p>
            <p>
               Across many major cities, a hazy brown soup of pollution hangs over the skyline, especially in the warmer months. This is smog, known more specifically as ground-level ozone.<br> Smog is formed when industrial emissions from power plants, factories, cars, and other sources react with heat and sunlight in the atmosphere.
            </p>
            <h2>Why is it harmful</h2>
            <p>When inhaled, smog irritates our airways, increasing our risk of serious heart and lung diseases. These health risks are why many cities monitor smog levels. On a high ozone-alert day, for example, your eyes and throat may burn, and you may cough and wheeze.</p>
